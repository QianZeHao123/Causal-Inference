Combining Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Difference in Differences (DiD), and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) can provide a comprehensive analysis of causal impacts in your study. Here's how you can effectively compare results from these methods:

### Step 1: Define Your Causal Question
First, clearly define your causal question. For instance, "What is the impact of narrowly winning an election on future policy changes or reelection success?" This question can be explored using RDD to define narrowly winning vs. losing, DiD to observe changes over time, and SCM to construct a counterfactual for narrowly lost elections.

### Step 2: Implement Each Method

- **RDD**: Identify the cutoff (e.g., a 0.5% margin in **close05**) and compare outcomes just above and below this threshold. This method helps establish a local causal effect at the margin of winning or losing.
  
- **DiD**: Use panel data to compare changes over time in outcomes (e.g., policy changes, reelection rates) for those just above and below the cutoff before and after the election.
  
- **Synthetic Control**: For the units that narrowly lost, construct a synthetic control group that is a weighted combination of other units that did not receive the treatment but had similar characteristics before the treatment. Compare the post-election outcomes of the narrowly lost units to their synthetic counterparts.

### Step 3: Compare and Contrast Findings
Once you have results from each method:
- **Compare Consistency**: Check if the direction and magnitude of the causal effects are consistent across methods. Consistency can strengthen the validity of your findings.
- **Discuss Differences**: Analyze why some methods might show different results. For instance, SCM can better control for unobservable confounders compared to RDD and DiD, which might lead to different conclusions about the impact of narrowly winning an election.
  
- **Robustness Checks**: Use each method as a robustness check for the others. If one method finds a significant effect and the others do not, investigate further to understand the discrepancies.

### Step 4: Interpret Results
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: By using these methods in tandem, you can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the causal effects. For example, RDD will give you insights at the cutoff, DiD will show the effect over time, and SCM will illustrate what could have happened if the close losers had won instead.
  
- **Policy Implications**: Discuss the implications of these findings for political strategy and policy-making. For instance, if narrowly winning affects policies significantly, this might influence campaign strategies.

### Step 5: Document and Share Findings
Ensure that your analysis, code, and datasets are well-documented. Consider sharing your findings through academic papers, conferences, or policy briefs. This transparency not only builds trust in your research but also allows others to replicate or extend your study, which is crucial for scientific progress.

By approaching your research question with these methods, you can provide a nuanced view of the causal effects and strengthen the reliability of your conclusions. Each method has its strengths and challenges, and together, they can offer a robust analysis that single-method studies might miss.

In the context of causal inference methods like RDD, DiD, and SCM, choosing the right variables is critical for the robustness and validity of your analysis. Let's review which variables are used for each method in your analysis, why they are chosen, and whether you can include more variables.

### Variables for Each Method and Their Selection Rationale:

#### 1. **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)**
- **Running Variable**: `DemPct` (Democratic percentage of the vote)
- **Outcome Variable**: `VoteTotW` (Total votes for the winning candidate)
- **Cutoff Variable**: `close05` (Indicator of a close election, possibly within 0.5 percentage points)

**Why These Variables**: 
- The `DemPct` serves as a good running variable because it directly influences whether a candidate narrowly wins or loses (the treatment effect). 
- `VoteTotW` is a clear outcome measure reflecting the immediate impact of winning.
- The `close05` helps define the precise threshold or cutoff around which you hypothesize causal effects to occur, essential for the RDD's focus on local causal inference around a defined point.

**Can We Choose More?**:
- Additional variables could include demographic or economic indicators such as `UrbanPct` or `BlackPct` to control for district characteristics that might influence the vote independent of the close win.

#### 2. **Difference in Differences (DiD)**
- **Group Variable**: `DemWin` (Whether Democrats won the election)
- **Time Variable**: `YearElec` (Election year to differentiate between pre and post periods)
- **Outcome Variable**: `VoteTotW`

**Why These Variables**: 
- `DemWin` naturally splits the dataset into treatment and control groups based on whether Democrats won, key for assessing changes over time.
- `YearElec` allows differentiation between before and after periods, central to DiD's requirement for time-series data.
- `VoteTotW` as the outcome provides a direct measure of electoral success, central to understanding the impact of election wins over time.

**Can We Choose More?**:
- Yes, including variables like `GovDem` (whether the governor is a Democrat) might help understand broader political influences. Economic variables or policy changes during different terms could also be insightful.

#### 3. **Synthetic Control Method (SCM)**
- **Predictor Variables**: `VoteTotW`, `DemPct`, `UrbanPct`, `BlackPct` 
- **Dependent Variable**: `VoteTotL` (Total votes for the losing candidate)

**Why These Variables**: 
- These variables are chosen to create a synthetic control that mirrors the treated unit but did not receive the treatment. The selection is based on factors that are assumed to influence electoral outcomes and thus need to be similar between the treated and control units for credible synthetic construction.

**Can We Choose More?**:
- Absolutely, expanding to include variables such as `GovWkPct` (Percentage of government workers) or economic indicators could refine the synthetic control by ensuring it accounts for more nuanced socio-economic factors influencing election outcomes.

### General Advice for Variable Selection:
- **Relevance**: Choose variables that are directly relevant to the causal mechanism you are investigating.
- **Availability**: Ensure the data is available and accurately measured across all units and time points.
- **Non-Collinearity**: Be mindful of including highly correlated predictors that could distort the analysis.
- **Control for Confounders**: Include variables that might confound the relationship between the treatment and outcome.

When selecting variables, always go back to your research question to determine what factors might influence the relationship you are studying. Additionally, consult the literature to understand what variables have been used in similar studies and why they might be important.
