Combining Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Difference in Differences (DiD), and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) can provide a comprehensive analysis of causal impacts in your study. Here's how you can effectively compare results from these methods:

### Step 1: Define Your Causal Question
First, clearly define your causal question. For instance, "What is the impact of narrowly winning an election on future policy changes or reelection success?" This question can be explored using RDD to define narrowly winning vs. losing, DiD to observe changes over time, and SCM to construct a counterfactual for narrowly lost elections.

### Step 2: Implement Each Method

- **RDD**: Identify the cutoff (e.g., a 0.5% margin in **close05**) and compare outcomes just above and below this threshold. This method helps establish a local causal effect at the margin of winning or losing.
  
- **DiD**: Use panel data to compare changes over time in outcomes (e.g., policy changes, reelection rates) for those just above and below the cutoff before and after the election.
  
- **Synthetic Control**: For the units that narrowly lost, construct a synthetic control group that is a weighted combination of other units that did not receive the treatment but had similar characteristics before the treatment. Compare the post-election outcomes of the narrowly lost units to their synthetic counterparts.

### Step 3: Compare and Contrast Findings
Once you have results from each method:
- **Compare Consistency**: Check if the direction and magnitude of the causal effects are consistent across methods. Consistency can strengthen the validity of your findings.
- **Discuss Differences**: Analyze why some methods might show different results. For instance, SCM can better control for unobservable confounders compared to RDD and DiD, which might lead to different conclusions about the impact of narrowly winning an election.
  
- **Robustness Checks**: Use each method as a robustness check for the others. If one method finds a significant effect and the others do not, investigate further to understand the discrepancies.

### Step 4: Interpret Results
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: By using these methods in tandem, you can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the causal effects. For example, RDD will give you insights at the cutoff, DiD will show the effect over time, and SCM will illustrate what could have happened if the close losers had won instead.
  
- **Policy Implications**: Discuss the implications of these findings for political strategy and policy-making. For instance, if narrowly winning affects policies significantly, this might influence campaign strategies.

### Step 5: Document and Share Findings
Ensure that your analysis, code, and datasets are well-documented. Consider sharing your findings through academic papers, conferences, or policy briefs. This transparency not only builds trust in your research but also allows others to replicate or extend your study, which is crucial for scientific progress.

By approaching your research question with these methods, you can provide a nuanced view of the causal effects and strengthen the reliability of your conclusions. Each method has its strengths and challenges, and together, they can offer a robust analysis that single-method studies might miss.
